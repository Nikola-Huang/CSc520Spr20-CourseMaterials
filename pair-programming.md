# Pair Programming

Some of the homework assignment problems have been designated
as being amenable to pair programming.  This document describes 
how pair programming works in CSc 520.

## MAX 3 assignments for a particular pairing

In CSc 520, pair programming is always an opportunity,
never an obligation. You are not required to work in pairs.
If you do choose to work in a pair—which I recommend—
know that **no single pair may work together on more than
three assignments**. If you need help finding a partner,
advertise on Piazza.

## How do pair-programming interactions work?

In pair programming, you work with a partner under the following
constraints:

 * When work is being done on the program, both partners are
   present at the computer. One partner holds the keyboard;
   the other watches the screen. Both partners talk, and the
   keyboard should change hands occasionally.

   If you are in the middle of a pair-programming project and
   your partner has to travel for a day or two, it is permissible
   for you to continue working together using a tool like
   TeamViewer, provided that you also maintain a real-time
   audio connection. (TeamViewer allows two programmers to
   work on one computer by enabling one computer to "control"
   another.)

 * You submit a single program under both your names. That
   work gets one grade, which you both receive.

While we strongly encourage both discussion and pair programming, 
we are also charged with guarding UofA's standards of
academic integrity. The following policies help ensure that these
standards are upheld:

 * If circumstances, such as scheduling difficulties, make it
   impossible for you to work as part of a pair, you may ask
   the course staff for permission to divide an assignment into
   parts and to do some parts as a member of a pair and other
   parts as an individual. Such parts must appear in different
   files, and each file must be clearly identified as the work
   of an individual or the work of a pair. Work done jointly
   by the pair should be submitted by both members of the
   pair. Files containing joint work must be identical. If you
   as an individual modify a file containing joint work, and
   you submit the modified file, that act will be considered a
   violation of academic integrity.
   
 * It is never acceptable to divide an assignment into parts and
   have some parts done by one partner and other parts done by
   the other. Submitting work done by someone else as your
   own will be considered an egregious violation of academic
   integrity. Submitting individual work as the product of
   pair programming is also a violation of academic integrity.

## Do I have a right to pair program?

Pair programming is a privilege, not a right. If you foul up and
don't fix it, I may revoke your pair-programming privileges. 
Fouling up consists in any of the following unacceptable behavior:
 * Repeatedly failing to keep appointments with your partner
 * Lying to your partner about what you have done
 * Violating academic integrity
 * Other similarly egregious offenses
 
## What if pair programming doesn’t work for me?

In CSc 520, you are never required to pair program. If you try
pair programming and find it is not working, or if your programming 
partner disappears in mid-project, proceed as follows:
 * Notify your partner that you wish to discontinue the pairing.
   You needn't explain yourself; a simple wish to stop is reason
   enough.
 * Submit the work done in partnership at that point in a private
   piazza post to the instructor, even if it is incomplete or broken.
   That work is "community property" and both students may submit it.
 * If you wish, follow up with an additional submission of
   whatever you complete on your own.
