# Syllabus for CSc 520: Principles of Programming Languages

Gould-Simpson 701, Mondays and Wednesdays 3:30-4:45pm
	
## Description of Course

This course will define, analyze, and evaluate important concepts found in current 
programming languages. Its goals are to build an ability to evaluate and compare 
programming languages, both from the user's and implementor's view, and to develop 
precise mechanisms for specifying the semantics of programming languages.

This course is with permission closely based on CS 105 developed and taught at 
Tufts by Norman Ramsey (https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/105-2019s/index.html) and 
Kathleen Fisher (https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/105-2017f/index.html).

## Course Prerequisites

Prerequisite skills for this course include
* at least three semesters of programming experience,
  * (have implemented some of the basic data structures
     and algorithms such as stacks, queues, lists, tables,
     standard sorting,
  * some experience programming in C or C++),

* a discrete math course
  * (induction,
  * propositional and predicate calculi, eg. forall and exists, 
  * and set theory),

* and basic unix skills
  * (basics of files and directories,
  * creating and editing files,
  * compiling and loading programs,
  * and using make).

Suggested prerequisites for this course include an undergraduate programming 
languages course like CSc 372, a compilers course like 453, and an 
undergraduate algorithms or theory course.

## Course Format and Teaching Methods

FIXME

The course will consist of instructor and student-led discussions of research papers.  Students will also do a semester-long research project.  The course will also include writing reviews for each of the papers read and presenting papers to the class. This course does not involve a textbook or any exams, but there will be reading quizzes.

## Course Objectives

FIXME

Students will learn how to synthesize a number of papers that attempt to solve similar research problems, make comparisons between such papers, and identify remaining limitations that could lead to future research.  Additional research skills students will learn include effectively communicating research verbally and in writing and executing their own, related, semester-long research projects.  For this offering of 620, students will learn what aspects affect the design and implementation of embedded domain specific languages (EDSL) in a number of contexts.  


## Expected Learning Outcomes

FIXME

Identify and summarize the research problem, context, proposed approach, evaluation, and limitations in research papers.
Organize and plan the execution of a research project.
Effectively communicate the problem being solved, context, proposed approach, evaluation, and limitations of their own research project.
Provide constructive suggestions to others in the course about their research projects.

## Scheduled Topics/Activities

FIXME

## Department of Computer Science Code of Conduct

The Department of Computer Science is committed to providing and maintaining a supportive 
educational environment for all.  We strive to be welcoming and inclusive, respect privacy 
and confidentiality, behave respectfully and courteously, and practice intellectual honesty.  
Disruptive behaviors (such as physical or emotional harassment, dismissive attitudes, and 
abuse of department resources) will not be tolerated.  The complete Code of Conduct is available 
on our department web site.  We expect that you will adhere to this code, as well as the UA 
Student Code of Conduct, while you are a member of this class.

## Classroom Behavior Policy

To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors have a shared 
responsibility.  We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us feel 
comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, 
our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting, chatting, 
reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.).

The use of personal electronics such as laptops, iPads, and other such mobile devices is 
distracting to the other students and the instructor. Their use can degrade the learning 
environment. Therefore, students are not permitted to use these devices during the class 
period unless they are specifically taking notes.  Taking notes means students are typing 
down ideas in some text format.  Any web searches will need to be done outside of class.

## Pronoun Preference
All people have the right to be addressed and referred to in accordance with their personal 
identity.  In this class, we will have the chance to indicate the name that we prefer to be 
called and, if we choose, to identify pronouns with which we would like to be addressed. I 
will do my best to address and refer to all students accordingly and support classmates in 
doing so as well.

## My preferred pronouns are she/her/hers.

In a graduate course, students are free to call me “Michelle” instead of “Dr. Strout”.  
Please respect that all students will pick whichever of these they are most comfortable with.

## Threatening Behavior Policy

The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of physical harm to any 
member of the University community, including to oneself. See 
http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students. 

## Accessibility and Accommodations

The Disability Resources Offices provides guidelines regarding accessibility and 
accommodations:  http://drc.arizona.edu/instructors/syllabus-statement.

## Code of Academic Integrity

Students are encouraged to share intellectual views and discuss freely the principles and 
applications of course materials. However, graded work/exercises must be the product of 
independent effort unless otherwise instructed. Students are expected to adhere to the UA 
Code of Academic Integrity as described in the UA General Catalog. See 
http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/academic-integrity/students/academic-integrity.

The University Libraries have some excellent tips for avoiding plagiarism, available at 
http://new.library.arizona.edu/research/citing/plagiarism.

Selling class notes and/or other course materials to other students or to a third party 
for resale is not permitted without the instructor’s express written consent. Violations 
to this and other course rules are subject to the Code of Academic Integrity and may result 
in course sanctions. Additionally, students who use D2L or UA e-mail to sell or buy these 
copyrighted materials are subject to Code of Conduct Violations for misuse of student 
e-mail addresses. This conduct may also constitute copyright infringement.

## UA Nondiscrimination and Anti-harassment Policy 

The University is committed to creating and maintaining an environment free of discrimination; 
see http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy

Our classroom is a place where everyone is encouraged to express well-formed opinions and 
their reasons for those opinions. We also want to create a tolerant and open environment 
where such opinions can be expressed without resorting to bullying or discrimination of others.

## Subject to Change Statement

Information contained in the course syllabus, other than the grade and absence policy, may 
be subject to change with advance notice, as deemed appropriate by the instructor.


The University of Arizona sits on the original homelands of indigenous peoples who have stewarded 
this land since time immemorial. Aligning with the university’s core value of a diverse and 
inclusive community, it is an institutional responsibility to recognize and acknowledge the
people, culture, and history that make up the Wildcat community. At the institutional level, 
it is important to be proactive in broadening awareness throughout campus to ensure our students 
feel represented and valued.
